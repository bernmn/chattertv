# AWS S3 Integration Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to properly enable AWS S3 integration in the ChatterStream video sharing platform. The changes ensure that uploaded videos and their thumbnails are properly stored in the configured AWS S3 bucket.

## Issue Identified
The main issue was in the video processing function in `server/routes.ts`. There was a hardcoded message stating "AWS disconnected, using local storage only" which was bypassing the S3 upload functionality entirely, even though the S3 configuration was correct and all environment variables were properly set.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Video Upload Process
Modified the `processVideoUpload` function in `server/routes.ts` to:
- Check if S3 integration is enabled (via `USE_S3`)
- Upload video files to the S3 bucket using the `uploadFileToS3` function
- Upload thumbnails to the S3 bucket
- Store the S3 keys in the database for future reference
- Keep local files as backup for redundancy

```typescript
// Try to upload to S3 if it's enabled
if (USE_S3) {
  try {
    console.log('Uploading files to S3...');
    
    // Upload video to S3
    const videoKey = `uploads/${filename}`;
    const s3VideoUrl = await uploadFileToS3(videoFullPath, videoKey, req.file.mimetype);
    videoPath = videoKey; // Store the S3 key in the database
    
    // Upload thumbnail to S3 if we have one
    if (thumbnailSuccess) {
      const thumbnailKey = `thumbnails/${thumbnailFilename}`;
      const s3ThumbnailUrl = await uploadFileToS3(thumbnailFullPath, thumbnailKey, 'image/jpeg');
      thumbnailPath = thumbnailKey; // Store the S3 key in the database
    }
    
    console.log('Successfully uploaded files to S3');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to upload to S3, falling back to local storage:', error);
    // Fallback to local storage (paths already set)
  }
} else {
  console.log('AWS S3 integration is disabled, using local storage.');
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Video Deletion
Updated the video deletion endpoint to clean up files from both S3 and local storage:
- First try to delete files from S3 if the path looks like an S3 key
- Fall back to local deletion if S3 deletion fails
- Always clean up local files for completeness

```typescript
// Try deleting from S3 first if the path looks like an S3 key
if (USE_S3 && video.filePath && !video.filePath.includes("://")) {
  try {
    console.log('Attempting to delete video from S3:', video.filePath);
    await deleteFileFromS3(video.filePath);
    
    // Also delete thumbnail from S3
    if (video.thumbnailPath) {
      console.log('Attempting to delete thumbnail from S3:', video.thumbnailPath);
      await deleteFileFromS3(video.thumbnailPath);
    }
  } catch (s3Error) {
    console.error('Error deleting files from S3:', s3Error);
    // Continue to try local deletion as fallback
  }
}
```

### 3. Created S3 Bucket Checking Utility
Created `check-s3-videos.js` to easily verify the contents of the S3 bucket:
- Lists videos stored in the `uploads/` prefix
- Lists thumbnails stored in the `thumbnails/` prefix
- Displays file size and last modified date
- Sorts by most recently uploaded first

## Testing Verification
Testing confirmed that uploads are now correctly stored in the S3 bucket:
1. Uploaded a test video file through the application
2. Verified logs showed "Successfully uploaded files to S3"
3. Ran the `check-s3-videos.js` utility which confirmed:
   - Video file uploaded to: `uploads/00483a0e-5941-4c78-bf2d-e15dcda3e30b.mp4`
   - Thumbnail uploaded to: `thumbnails/thumbnail-474a6e16-5e51-45af-9e57-96657bf41438.jpg`

## Environment Setup
The following environment variables are used for S3 configuration:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (e.g., us-east-2)
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET`: Name of the S3 bucket (e.g., bg-test-2018)

## Backup
A backup of the working implementation was created in the `backups/` directory for reference and rollback if needed.
